### How to play the game
Two players start with 7 pieces. Players take turns rolling 4 dice, and move a piece 1 cell for each marked die. The goal is to move all 7 pieces through the entire board. You can't have more than one piece on a cell. If you move a piece onto a cell occupied by the other player, their piece is moved off the board.
<br />
<br />
If a piece is moved onto a flower, that player rolls their dice again. A piece on a flower is safe from being moved off the board. Due to the layout of the board and the paths of each player, the first 4 cells and the last 2 cells are always safe from having a piece moved off the board.
